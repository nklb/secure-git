Script to switch git remote url from https to ssh

This automates the procedure described on this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-a-remotes-url#switching-remote-urls-from-https-to-ssh).
Useful for people like me who prefer to quickly copy the https url of a repository from the browser to clone it but actually want to use ssh urls.

Works for github and gitlab repositories.
